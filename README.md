# Trading Bot Project

## Introduction

This project represents my journey in developing an automated trading bot designed to interact with cryptocurrency exchanges through APIs. The bot aims to streamline processes by leveraging Python and the WOOX API to fetch market data, analyse trends, and execute trades automatically. The ultimate goal is to build a robust, scalable, and efficient system capable of supporting algorithmic trading strategies across various markets.

The bot operates based on the following key components:

### Features
1. **Automated Data Retrieval**: The bot fetches trade history and candlestick data for tokens listed on WOOX, enabling dynamic and real-time decision-making.
2. **Indicators**:
   - Stochastic RSI
   - Slow Stochastic (two variations)
   - Supertrend Indicator
   - Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
   - Moving Averages (MA)
3. **Entry and Exit Logic**:
   - The bot evaluates conditions across multiple timeframes (1-hour, 15-minute, and 5-minute) to ensure robust entries.
   - Trades are exited when a 2.5% profit or loss is achieved.
4. **Risk Management**:
   - The maximum capital per trade is capped at $1000.
   - Stop-loss levels are strictly enforced.
5. **Notifications**:
   - Email alerts are sent upon executing a trade.
6. **Logging and Analytics**:
   - Detailed logs are saved for performance review.
   - Graphs and reports summarise daily profit/loss and strategy performance.

## Future Plans

I plan to evolve this bot in the following ways:

1. **Backtesting and Optimisation**:
   - Integrate a robust backtesting framework to test the strategy on historical data.
   - Fine-tune the parameters of indicators to optimise performance.

2. **Machine Learning**:
   - Introduce predictive models using TensorFlow to analyse trends and improve decision-making.
   - Explore reinforcement learning for dynamic strategy adaptation.

3. **Hosting**:
   - Deploy the bot on Azure using Docker for scalability and reliability.
   - Optimise deployment to reduce latency by selecting servers close to the WOOX exchange.

4. **Database Integration**:
   - Implement PostgreSQL to store trade history, backtesting results, and performance logs.
   - Use Neo4j to map relationships between indicators and trade outcomes.

5. **TradingView Integration**:
   - Set up TradingView alerts and webhook integration to enhance signal accuracy.

6. **Multi-Token Support**:
   - Expand the botâ€™s capabilities to analyse and trade multiple tokens simultaneously.

   - Utilised the `dotenv` library to securely manage API keys and secrets in a `.env` file, ensuring sensitive information is not exposed in the codebase.

2. **Timestamp Generation:**
   - Created a function to generate a 13-digit Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for API request signing and synchronisation with the exchange server.

3. **HMAC-SHA256 Signature Creation:**
   - Developed a function to generate secure signatures using the API secret, ensuring integrity and authenticity of API requests.

4. **Fetching Trade History:**
   - Implemented an API call to fetch historical trade data from the exchange for a specified time range.
   - Integrated query parameter construction, signature generation, and HTTP headers setup to comply with the exchangeâ€™s API requirements.

5. **Debugging and Error Handling:**
   - Added print statements to debug the request flow (e.g., query strings, headers, and signature details).
   - Included exception handling to manage HTTP request errors gracefully.

### Code Use in Bot Development

The current code is foundational for:
- **Data Retrieval:** The `fetch_trade_history` function provides access to historical trading data, which is essential for backtesting strategies and understanding market behaviour.
- **Authentication Workflow:** The implementation of secure API authentication sets the groundwork for other bot functionalities, such as placing orders or monitoring account balances.
- **Scalable Design:** Modular functions make it easy to expand and integrate additional features like real-time data fetching, order placement, and portfolio management.

## Code Demonstration and Output

### Code Overview

#### Purpose of the Code:
The script demonstrates the process of securely fetching trade history from a cryptocurrency exchange using its API. It includes:
1. **Environment Configuration:** Securely loading API keys from a `.env` file.
2. **API Authentication:** Generating HMAC-SHA256 signatures for secure requests.
3. **Data Retrieval:** Fetching trade history for a specific symbol over a specified time range.

#### Key Components:
- **`get_timestamp`:** Generates a Unix timestamp in milliseconds to synchronise with the API.
- **`create_signature`:** Generates a cryptographic signature for API requests using the secret key and payload.
- **`fetch_trade_history`:** Sends a GET request to fetch trade history, building the query string, headers, and signature dynamically.

### Sample Output

#### Request Debugging:
```plaintext
Request URL: https://api.woox.io/v1/client/trades
Headers: {
  'x-api-key': '...',
  'x-api-signature': '...',
  'x-api-timestamp': '...',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
Query String: end_t=1737065089590&page=1&size=25&start_t=1729289089590&symbol=PERP_POWR_USDT
```

#### Response:
```plaintext
Response Status Code: 200
Response Content: {
  "success": true,
  "meta": {"total": 25, "records_per_page": 100, "current_page": 1},
  "rows": [
    {"id": 1391018966, "symbol": "PERP_POWR_USDT", "side": "SELL", ...},
    {"id": 1391018965, "symbol": "PERP_POWR_USDT", "side": "SELL", ...},
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### Parsed Output (Sample Rows):
| Trade ID     | Symbol          | Side | Executed Price | Quantity | Fee   | Fee Asset |
|--------------|-----------------|------|----------------|----------|-------|-----------|
| 1391018966  | PERP_POWR_USDT  | SELL | 0.3405         | 710      | 0.120 | USDT      |
| 1391018965  | PERP_POWR_USDT  | SELL | 0.3406         | 856      | 0.145 | USDT      |
| 1391018964  | PERP_POWR_USDT  | SELL | 0.3406         | 3506     | 0.597 | USDT      |

### Explanation:
1. **Request Debugging:** Debugging information ensures the request is constructed correctly and helps trace issues.
2. **Response Content:** The JSON response includes metadata (e.g., total records and pagination) and trade data such as executed price, quantity, and fees.
3. **Parsed Data:** The parsed table highlights key fields, making it easier to visualise the trade history.

### Significant Milestone: Fetching Data for Multiple Tokens

#### Description:
Building upon the initial functionality, the project has been extended to:
1. Retrieve historical trade data for multiple cryptocurrency tokens dynamically.
2. Save the trade data for each token in a separate `.csv` file.
3. Combine all retrieved data into a single `.csv` file for comprehensive analysis.

This implementation demonstrates scalability and prepares the system for broader market analysis and strategy development.

#### Key Features of the Code:
- **Dynamic Token Handling:** Automatically fetches data for a list of predefined tokens.
- **Pagination:** Retrieves complete historical data by iterating through multiple pages of API responses.
- **Export to CSV:** Exports both individual token data and aggregated data for easy analysis.
