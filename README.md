# Trading Bot Project

## Introduction

This project represents my journey in developing an automated trading bot designed to interact with cryptocurrency exchanges through APIs. The bot aims to streamline processes by leveraging Python and the WOOX API to fetch market data, analyse trends, and execute trades automatically. The ultimate goal is to build a scalable, and efficient system capable of supporting algorithmic trading strategies across various markets.

The bot operates based on the following components:

### Features
1. **Automated Data Retrieval**: The bot fetches trade history and candlestick data for tokens listed on WOOX, enabling dynamic and real-time decision-making.
2. **Indicators**:
   - Stochastic RSI
   - Slow Stochastic (two variations)
   - Supertrend Indicator
   - Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
   - Moving Averages (MA)
3. **Entry and Exit Logic**:
   - The bot evaluates conditions across multiple timeframes (1-hour, 15-minute, and 5-minute) to ensure robust entries.
   - Trades are exited when a 2.5% profit or loss is achieved.
4. **Risk Management**:
   - The max capital per trade is capped at $1000.
   - Stoploss levels are strictly enforced.
5. **Notifications**: (in progress)
   - Email alerts are sent upon executing a trade.
6. **Logging and Analytics**: 
   - Detailed logs are saved for performance review.
   - Graphs and reports summarise daily profit/loss and strategy performance.

### 1. Stochastic RSI
The **Stochastic RSI** combines the relative strength index (RSI) and stochastic oscillator to identify overbought and oversold conditions:
- **Purpose**: Detect momentum shifts in price action.
- **Implementation**:
  - Calculate RSI over a defined period.
  - Identify the highest and lowest RSI values within a rolling window.
  - Compute the stochastic oscillator of the RSI values.

### 2. Slow Stochastic
The **Slow Stochastic** smooths the regular stochastic oscillator:
- **Purpose**: Mitigate noise and provide clearer trend signals.
- **Implementation**:
  - Smooth `%K` (raw stochastic) with a simple moving average.
  - Smooth `%D` (signal line) over a shorter period.

### 3. Supertrend Indicator
The **Supertrend Indicator** highlights market trends based on average true range (ATR):
- **Purpose**: Identify potential trend reversals.
- **Implementation**:
  - Compute ATR for price volatility.
  - Create upper and lower bands based on ATR and price movement.

### 4. Moving Averages (MA & EMA)
- **Moving Averages (MA)** smooth historical prices over a defined window to reduce noise.
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)** assign greater weight to recent prices to react faster to price changes.

## Current Progress

### Functionality Implemented:

1. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Utilised the `dotenv` library to securely manage API keys and secrets in a `.env` file, ensuring sensitive information is not exposed in the codebase.

2. **Timestamp Generation:**
   - Created a function to generate a 13-digit Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for API request signing and synchronisation with the exchange server.

3. **HMAC-SHA256 Signature Creation:**
   - Developed a function to generate secure signatures using the API secret, ensuring integrity and authenticity of API requests.

4. **Fetching Trade History:**
   - Implemented an API call to fetch historical trade data from the exchange for a specified time range.
   - Integrated query parameter construction, signature generation, and HTTP headers setup to comply with the exchangeâ€™s API requirements.

5. **Debugging and Error Handling:**
   - Added print statements to debug the request flow (e.g., query strings, headers, and signature details).
   - Included exception handling to manage HTTP request errors gracefully.

### Code Use in Bot Development

#### Purpose of the Code:
The script demonstrates the process of securely fetching trade history from a cryptocurrency exchange using its API. It includes:
1. **Environment Configuration:** Securely loading API keys from a `.env` file.
2. **API Authentication:** Generating HMAC-SHA256 signatures for secure requests.
3. **Data Retrieval:** Fetching trade history for a specific symbol over a specified time range.

#### Key Components:
- **`get_timestamp`:** Generates a Unix timestamp in milliseconds to synchronise with the API.
- **`create_signature`:** Generates a cryptographic signature for API requests using the secret key and payload.
- **`fetch_trade_history`:** Sends a GET request to fetch trade history, building the query string, headers, and signature dynamically.

### Sample Output

#### Request Debugging:
```plaintext
Request URL: https://api.woox.io/v1/client/trades
Headers: {
  'x-api-key': '...',
  'x-api-signature': '...',
  'x-api-timestamp': '...',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
Query String: end_t=1737065089590&page=1&size=25&start_t=1729289089590&symbol=PERP_POWR_USDT
```

#### Response:
```plaintext
Response Status Code: 200
Response Content: {
  "success": true,
  "meta": {"total": 25, "records_per_page": 100, "current_page": 1},
  "rows": [
    {"id": 1391018966, "symbol": "PERP_POWR_USDT", "side": "SELL", ...},
    {"id": 1391018965, "symbol": "PERP_POWR_USDT", "side": "SELL", ...},
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### Output (Sample Rows):
| Trade ID     | Symbol          | Side | Executed Price | Quantity | Fee   | Fee Asset |
|--------------|-----------------|------|----------------|----------|-------|-----------|
| 1391018966  | PERP_POWR_USDT  | SELL | 0.3405         | 710      | 0.120 | USDT      |
| 1391018965  | PERP_POWR_USDT  | SELL | 0.3406         | 856      | 0.145 | USDT      |
| 1391018964  | PERP_POWR_USDT  | SELL | 0.3406         | 3506     | 0.597 | USDT      |

1. **Request Debugging:** Debugging information ensures the request is constructed correctly and helps trace issues.
2. **Response Content:** The JSON response includes metadata (e.g., total records and pagination) and trade data such as executed price, quantity, and fees.
3. **Parsed Data:** The parsed table highlights key fields, making it easier to visualise the trade history.

### Significant Milestone: Fetching Data for Multiple Tokens

Building upon the initial functionality, the project has been extended to:
1. Retrieve historical trade data for multiple cryptocurrency tokens dynamically.
2. Save the trade data for each token in a separate `.csv` file.
3. Combine all retrieved data into a single `.csv` file for comprehensive analysis.

This implementation demonstrates scalability and prepares the system for broader market analysis and strategy development.

#### Features of the Code:
- **Dynamic Token Handling:** Automatically fetches data for a list of predefined tokens.
- **Pagination:** Retrieves complete historical data by iterating through multiple pages of API responses.
- **Export to CSV:** Exports both individual token data and aggregated data for easy analysis.

## Conclusion

This project is an ongoing exploration of algorithmic trading. It combines my passion for technology and financial markets, leveraging Python and industry-standard tools to create a professional-grade trading bot.
